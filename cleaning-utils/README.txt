This script was designed to clean up the project directory for my first web page. I added a ton of assets that I never ended up using. Finding the unused assets manually looked like a very tedious task, and I couldn't find a way to get it done more quickly. I'm sure it's out there already, but I figured I'd just write it myself rather than spend more time searching. So here we are.
